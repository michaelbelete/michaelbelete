### ✨ What I’m about
I ship fast, keep the UI calm, and let the architecture carry its weight.  
Most days I’m toggling between **React/SvelteKit**, **Node/Python**, and a sprinkle of **cloud/devops** to get ideas into users’ hands—quickly.

---

### 🧰 Tools I actually reach for
**Core:** TypeScript, React, Svelte/SvelteKit, Node.js, Python  
**Also comfortable with:** Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, Django, FastAPI, Flask  
**Data & infra:** PostgreSQL, SQL/NoSQL, Redis  
**Cloudy stuff:** AWS, Docker, Vercel, Netlify, Upstash, CI/CD, GraphQL, REST, tRPC

> I pick tools for the problem, not the other way around.

---

### 🗺️ What I’m building (high-level)
- Useful AI features that **assist**, not overwhelm.
- Small services that talk well to each other (serverless when it helps, boring monoliths when it’s wiser).
- Interfaces that feel **obvious** on first click.

---

### 🔍 Selected things I’ve shipped (human-sized blurbs)
- **AI SaaS** for high-stakes analysis — handled data, infra, and the tiny UI details that keep it approachable.  
- **Health app features** used by real people every day — serverless CRUD, helpful docs, fewer support pings.  
- **Presentation/ops tools** that make teammates look good in demos and ship rooms.

(If you’re curious about architecture choices, I wrote about **SvelteKit + tRPC** for scalable apps → https://michaelbelete.com/sveltekit-trpc-scalable-apps/)

---

### 💡 Principles I don’t shut up about
- **Ship the smallest useful thing.** Measure. Then ship again.  
- **Make UI quiet.** Remove decisions users shouldn’t make.  
- **Logs are a UX too.** DevEx is part of product.  
- **Choose boring when it’s safer.** New ≠ better.
